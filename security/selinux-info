Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel 
security module that provides the mechanism for supporting 
access control security policies.

SELinux has three available modes:

1)Disabled   --> SELinux is turned off and does not restrict
                 any action.
2)Permissive --> In permissive mode any SELinux security 
                 violation would be logged only, it means
                 in permissive mode security violation
                 would not be stopped.
3)Enforcing  --> In enforcing mode any SELinux security
                 violation would be logged and service would 
                 stop. Any action that violate SELinux rule 
                 would be denied.
